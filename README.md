<h1>Hello, Folks!</h2>
I am oseamiya, an android developer from Nepal ðŸ’–:nepal: .
I create blog posts in my website, <a href="https://www.oseamiya.com/"> Oseamiya</a> and open-source packages related to android-development and AppInventor extensions.
I have a passion for learning & sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's public as much as I can.
